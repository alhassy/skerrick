#+TITLE: Notes

* Test Suite
** [ ] Make it easy to visually map the input lines of code -> output lines
* TODOs
** [X] Fix exports: bindings being repeated N! times
CLOSED: [2022-02-09 Wed 09:07]
** [X] Support importing of built-ins (e.g. ='fs'=)
** [ ] Auto-evaluation of dependencies (e.g. starting from =index.js=)
*** [ ] Test if cyclic deps are supported
*** The problem here is that the Skerrick needs to be able to access all the files of the project.
- Either, Skerrick is started as part of the project OR
- The editor sends Skerrick the files it needs to evaluate - 2 way comms needed
For now, I'll support the former since it seems easier to do. Actually, the latter might not be feasible. Imagine having to send MBs of node_modules files across the wire!
** [ ] Support commonjs modules
** [ ] Stack traces

** [ ] Support dynamic imports
** [ ] Typescript support
* Document caveats
- Normal execution: error when undefined identifier vs Skerrick: No error
