#+TITLE: Notes

* Test Suite
** [ ] Make it easy to visually map the input lines of code -> output lines
* TODOs
** [X] Fix exports: bindings being repeated N! times
CLOSED: [2022-02-09 Wed 09:07]
** [X] Support importing of built-ins (e.g. ='fs'=)
** [X] Auto-evaluation of dependencies (e.g. starting from =index.js=)
*** [X] Test if cyclic deps are supported
*** The problem here is that the Skerrick needs to be able to access all the files of the project.
- Either, Skerrick is started as part of the project OR
- The editor sends Skerrick the files it needs to evaluate - 2 way comms needed
For now, I'll support the former since it seems easier to do. Actually, the latter might not be feasible. Imagine having to send MBs of node_modules files across the wire!
** [ ] Support commonjs modules [3/9]
*** [X] module.exports = { x: 1 }
CLOSED: [2022-02-24 Thu 17:40]
- This should export ={ x: 1 }= as =default=, but also export =x: 1=
*** [X] module.exports.x = 'something'
CLOSED: [2022-02-24 Thu 17:40]
*** [ ] exports = { x: 1 }
*** [ ] exports.x = 'something'
*** [X] require('ns')
CLOSED: [2022-02-24 Thu 17:41]
*** [ ] require.resolve
*** [ ] Clean up of exports. At the moment, intermediate values stay in the namespaces
*** [ ] Auto-eval of cjs stuff. At the moment only es6 ones get auto-eval
** [ ] Stack traces
** [ ] Support dynamic imports
** [ ] Check behavior of native libs - is special consideration needed?
** [ ] Typescript support
* TODOs - Emacs
** [ ] JSON outputs are showing up as plists
** [ ] Overlays should disappear on movement
* Document caveats
- Normal execution: error when undefined identifier vs Skerrick: No error
